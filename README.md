# Jeff's Personal Website

Hi, my name is Jeff and I've founded [Grid Games](http://grid-games.com) together with my brother Joey. I'm a programmer and I love to create games. My previous project was [Ethereum](http://ethereum.org), which I founded as well.

My website is mostly a collection of randon thoughts, code, personal projects and ramblings about my game Grid Online (working title).

I go by [@jeffehh](http://twitter.com/jeffehh) on Twitter and you can contact me through electronic mail at jeff @ grid-games.com. I troll reddit as [jeffehh](http://reddit.com/u/jeffehhh). My LinkedIn is dead and I don't do Facebook since 2011.
